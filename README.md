# Zulu

Zulu is a project that consists of some modules, scripts, applications, etc. Open Source for private server developers regarding Metin2.
Occasionally I will work on this project little by little doing free releases and updates.

Each work will receive for my part the title of "Episode", I hope this project can go a bit further to help many who cannot access certain material due to lack of knowledge or resources.

Currently available:

  Episode 1- [Metin2 PayPal Payment Gateway [M.P.P.G]](https://github.com/JaydenAudriel/Zulu/tree/master/episode-1-mppg "Metin2 PayPal Payment Gateway [M.P.P.G]")
